# DSP learn

Sources:
* [CourseEra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dsp/home/welcome)
* [think-dsp](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-dsp/)

I suggest starting from [ThinkDSP/Fun_sample.ipynb](https://github.com/EfforiaKnight/dsplearn/blob/master/ThinkDSP/Fun%20Sample.ipynb) and from there go over all chapters.

If you want theme like this:  
![jupyter theme](https://github.com/EfforiaKnight/dsplearn/blob/master/JupyterTheme.png)

Copy [.jupyter](https://github.com/EfforiaKnight/dsplearn/tree/master/.jupyter) to:
* %userprofile% - for **Windows**
* $HOME - for **Linux**

If you want to modify the theme install: [jupyter-themes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes)

Have Fun!
